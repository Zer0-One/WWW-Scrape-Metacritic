WWW-Scrape-Metacritic version 0.01
==================================

This module implements functionality for scraping data from Metacritic's
website. It is highly dependent on Metacritic's markup (style names, element
heirarchy, etc.), and as such should be expected to break when the Metacritic
website changes significantly enough.

Currently, features include:
    - Lists of top rated games for each platform
    - Info for any given title
    - JSON output

For usage documentation, see `perldoc WWW::Scrape::Metacritic` after installing
this module.

New features will be added as I become more bored with the rest of my life.
