rest_ps3
========

This script presents a *very* simple REST API that may be queried for
information on PS3 games listed on Metacritic. All information is returned as
JSON, with content type "application/json". The API is presented as follows:
    
    GET at /games, which returns information on all 10 of Metacritic's top PS3 games
    GET at /games/$title, which returns information on the game you specify with $title

By default, this script starts an HTTP server in the foreground on port 3000.
To modify this behavior, see the command-line options with: 

    ./rest_ps3.pl --help

Dependencies:
    - Dancer >= 1.3202
